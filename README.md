# Exam-Schedular
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) from scratch in Python to generate a valid and optimized university **exam schedule**. The system ensures all hard constraints are strictly enforced while attempting to satisfy multiple soft constraints to enhance the usability and efficiency of the exam timetable.
